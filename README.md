# Check-List
Simple Checklist made with Chrome APIs like Chrome.Storage.Sync etc.. It was very fun.

This chrome extension may be posted to the Chrome Web Store ( my username is matthewyu30121 ), along with my previous Social Media Blocker.  This piece was definitely much more efficient and organized than the previous.
A testament to my improvement in coding.   Then again I was like 14 when I made messy piece of code.  I am hopeful to add more to this so that it is more applicable to my daily study needs.
Be wary of some updates!
